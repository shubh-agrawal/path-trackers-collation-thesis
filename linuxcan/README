System requirements:

* Linux 2.6.29 or later
* Header files and compiler for kernel compilation.
  In Ubuntu 14.04 e.g. this is accomplished by issuing the command:

    "sudo apt-get install build-essential"

  On some systems you may also need to issue:

    "sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`"

  NOTE! Having versions of the linux headers installed other than that of
        the currently running kernel may cause conflicts and faulty drivers.


Compilation:

* To build all drivers:

    "make"

  To install all drivers:

    "sudo make install"

  Note: it is advised to call "sudo make uninstall" before replacing installed
        drivers.

  To unload and uninstall all drivers:
    "sudo make uninstall"

  To install and load, virtual and PCI drivers:
    "sudo make load"

  Note: running "sudo make load" will also cause the virtual and PCI drivers to
        be loaded at boot time. This might be bad if experimenting with the
        device drivers.

  Note: it is never required to manually install or load any modules, create or
        edit files. This is taken care of the Makefile, in the root of the
        linuxcan directory.

* To build just a single driver, go to the corresponding subdirectory:

    "make"
    "sudo ./installscript.sh"

  Note: All device drivers use the kvcommon driver. If you want to build and
        install only particular device drivers, you will first need to build and
        install the kvcommon driver from the linuxcan/common directory using the
        method above.

* To build and load just a single driver (virtual or PCI), go to the
  corresponding subdirectory:

    "make"
    "sudo ./installscript.sh load"

  Note: See the note above, regarding the kvcommon driver.

* To build with debug printouts:

    "make KV_DEBUG_ON=1"

Debug levels and some other settings may be changed in config.mak.


Usage:

* USBcanII, Leaf and Mhydra will load/unload when inserting/removing the device
* For PCI-drivers (pciefd, pcican, and pcicanII), use modprobe to load and
  unload the drivers, e.g.:
    "modprobe pcican" to load pcican driver, and
    "modprobe -r pcican" unload pcican driver.
* Try examples in /usr/doc/canlib/examples/

NOTE! Please read ReleaseNotes before using the driver.


Troubleshooting:

* See doc/faq


Installed Files:

* Driver modules
----------------------------------
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/kvpciefd.ko     (PCIEcan)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/kvpcican.ko     (PCIcan)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/kvpcicanII.ko   (PCIcanII)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/kvvirtualcan.ko (Virtualcan)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/misc/usbcanII.ko (USBcanII)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/misc/leaf.ko     (Leaf)
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/misc/mhydra.ko   (Mhydra)

* Module setup
----------------------------------
On CentOS, RedHat, RHEL, Fedora and simlar systems, the following lines are
added to /etc/modprobe.conf, on Debian, Ubuntu, Trisquel and similar systems
they are added to /etc/modprobe.d/kvaser.conf.

for PCIEcan:

    alias pciefd kvpciefd
    install kvpciefd /usr/sbin/pciefd.sh start
    remove kvpciefd /usr/sbin/pciefd.sh stop

for PCIcan:

    alias pcican kvpcican
    install kvpcican /usr/sbin/pcican.sh start
    remove kvpcican /usr/sbin/pcican.sh stop

for PCIcan II:

    alias pcicanII kvpcicanII
    install kvpcicanII /usr/sbin/pcicanII.sh start
    remove kvpcicanII /usr/sbin/pcicanII.sh stop

for Virtualcan:

    alias virtualcan kvvirtualcan
    install kvvirtualcan /usr/sbin/virtualcan.sh start
    remove kvvirtualcan /usr/sbin/virtualcan.sh stop

In the same files, the following lines are added to blacklist SocketCAN:

    blacklist kvaser_usb
    blacklist kvaser_pci
    blacklist kvaser_pciefd

* Module loading
----------------------------------
/usr/sbin/pciefd.sh      (start/stop pciefd driver;      by modprobe or manually)
/usr/sbin/pcican.sh      (start/stop pcican driver;      by modprobe or manually)
/usr/sbin/pcicanII.sh    (start/stop pcicanII driver;    by modprobe or manually)
/usr/sbin/virtualcan.sh  (start/stop virtualcan driver;  by modprobe or manually)
/usr/sbin/usbcanII.sh    (start/stop usbcanII driver;    by udev or manually)
/usr/sbin/leaf.sh        (start/stop leaf driver;        by udev or manually)
/usr/sbin/mhydra.sh      (start/stop mhydra driver;      by udev or manually)

* Module loading at boot
----------------------------------
If the modules are installed with "sudo make load", the virtual and the PCI
drivers are added to /etc/modules-load.d/kvaser.conf. This will cause the
modules to be loaded at boot time.

* udev rules
----------------------------------
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-kvaser.rules

* Include files for canlib library
----------------------------------
/usr/include/canlib.h
/usr/include/canstat.h

* Canlib library and links
----------------------------------
/usr/lib/libcanlib.so
/usr/lib/libcanlib.so.1.1.0
